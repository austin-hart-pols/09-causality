# 09 - Causality and statistics

- Thinking scientifically  
- FPCI  
  - Define causal effect  
  - Potential outcomes framework
- Confronting FPCI  
- EX: Cohen & Dupas

# Preview

### Causality is a hell of a thing

- It is impossible to observe a causal effect directly (FPCI).

- Inferring causation requires untestable assumptions.

- Is that causal? Rule out three alternatives

- Valid causal inference starts with research design.

# Thinking scientfically

# The process  

- Causal questions: what is the effect of X on Y?

- Theory and hypotheses
  - **Theory** as baseline
  - **Hypotheses** as specific predictions
  
- Data gathering
  - Research design
  - Data collection
  
- Analysis
  
- Inference

# Inferences and validity

> I gather data for a study. For the cases I observe, I see a relationship between two variables, T and Y.

- **Causal inference:** attribution of an effect to a cause *within a study*. I infer that exposing the units in my sample to different values of T caused a change in Y.

- **External validity inference:** extending the results *beyond the study* to other:  
  - populations  
  - treatments  
  - outcomes  
  - contexts

# Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference


---
# Define a causal effect

For any individual, $i$, we could observe 

- $Y_{i,T=1}$, $i$'s response to treatment $(T=1)$
- $Y_{i,T=0}$, $i$'s response to control $(T=0)$

Calculate the causal effect of treatment on the measured outcome $Y$ as:  

$$Y_{i,T=1} - Y_{i,T=0}$$


---
# Why causality is unobservable

> We can observe a unit's response to treatment  $(Y_{i,T=1})$. 
> Or... we can observe the response without treatment $(Y_{i,T=2})$. 
> We cannot observe both for the same unit at the same time.  

- We can observe, at most, one *potential outcome*.  

- **IMPOSSIBLE to observe a causal effect directly**

- NOTE: Causal inference requires...
  - comparison: treatment 1 versus 2
  - counterfactual reasoning: what would have happened instead
  - potential exposability: units could receive any value of treatment
  
  
---
# Recovering the counterfactual

### Scientific solutions  

- Compare response across two units, $i$ and $j$: $Y_{i,T=1} - Y_{j,T=2}$  
- Expose unit to both treatments in sequence: $Y_{i,T=1,t} - Y_{i,T=2,t+1}$    


### Statistical solution

- Estimate the **Average Treatment Effect** over a large number of sampled units.

$$SATE = Avg_n[Y_i|T_i=1] - Avg_n[Y_i|T_i=2]$$

# FPCI in practice

# Establishing internal validity 

> I evaluate the relationship between prorportional voting systems (PR) and women's representation. On average, women hold 28% of seats in countries using PR versus 20% in countries without PR. Is this 8-point gap the causal effect of PR voting? 

### Alternative explanations to consider:  

- Bias due to reverse causality

- Bias due to confounding (selection/endogeneity)   

- Coincidence

# Bias due to reverse causality

- Exists when the outcome is acting on the proposed cause. $X \leftrightarrow Y$
- If $Y$ determines exposure to $X$, then the correlation reflects the effect of $Y$ on $X$ in full or in part.

> Could women's representation cause choice of electoral system?


---
# Bias due to confounding

- Selection/confounding bias exists when:
  - Treatment groups differ systematically by some factor, $Z$
  - *AND* $Z$ is a cause of $Y$
- In this case, the estimated effect of $X$ on $Y$ erroneously captures the influence of $Z$.

> Is there a variable related to electoral system that might also, independently, impact women's representation?


---
# Cosmic coincidence

> Could we see this relationship to chance alone?

Necessary solutions:  
- Test of statistical significance. 
- Specify plausible causal mechanism.
