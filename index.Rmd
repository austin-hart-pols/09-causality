# 09 - Causality and statistics

- Thinking scientifically  
- FPCI  
  - Defining "cause"  
  - Potential outcomes framework
- Confronting FPCI  
- EX: Cohen & Dupas

# Causality is a hell of a thing

- It is impossible to observe a causal effect directly (FPCI).

- Inferring causation requires untestable assumptions.

- Is that causal? Rule out three alternatives

- Valid causal inference starts with research design.

# Thinking scientfically

# The process  

- Causal questions: what is the effect of X on Y?  
  Note: quantitative projects come from quantitative questions

- Theory and hypotheses
  - **Theory** as baseline
  - **Hypotheses** as specific predictions
  
- Data gathering
  - Research design
  - Data collection
  
- Analysis
  
- Inference

# Inferences and validity

> I gather data for a study. For the cases I observe, I see a relationship between two variables, T and Y.

- **Causal inference:** attribution of an effect to a cause *within a study*. I infer that exposing the units in my sample to different values of T caused a change in Y.

- **External validity inference:** extending the results *beyond the study* to other:  
  - populations  
  - treatments  
  - outcomes  
  - contexts

# Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference


---
# Define a causal effect

For any individual, $i$, we could observe 

- $Y_{i,T=1}$, $i$'s response to treatment $(T=1)$  
- $Y_{i,T=0}$, $i$'s response to control $(T=0)$  

Define the causal effect of treatment on measured outcome $Y$ as:  

$$Y_{i,T=1} - Y_{i,T=0}$$


---
# Why causality is unobservable

> We can observe a unit's response to treatment  $(Y_{i,T=1})$. 
> Or... we can observe the response without treatment $(Y_{i,T=0})$. 
> We cannot observe both for the same unit at the same time.  

- We can observe, at most, one *potential outcome*.  

- **IMPOSSIBLE to observe a causal effect directly**

- NOTE: Causal inference requires...
  - comparison: treatment 1 versus 2
  - counterfactual reasoning: what would have happened instead
  - potential exposability: units could receive any value of treatment
  
  
---
# Recovering the counterfactual

### Scientific solutions  
- Compare response across two units, $i$ and $j$: $Y_{i,T=1} - Y_{j,T=2}$  
- ..or.. Expose unit to both treatments in sequence: $Y_{i,T=1,t} - Y_{i,T=2,t+1}$    
- Assumptions required?

### Statistical solution
- Estimate the **Average Treatment Effect** over a large number of sampled units.
$$ATE = Avg_n[Y_i|T_i=1] - Avg_n[Y_i|T_i=0]$$
- Assumptions required?

### A causal effect?
> Support for democracy is 10 points lower in countries exposed to high levels of Foreign Authoritarian Influence. Is this a causal effect of FAI? Possibly, yes.

### Alternative explanations:  

- **Bias due to reverse causality** $X \leftarrow Y$  
  If $Y$ determines exposure to $X$, even in part, the correlation reflects the effect of $Y$ on $X$.   
  
- **Bias due to confounding** $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$   
  - Treatment groups differ by some factor, $Z$, which is a cause of $Y$
  - Correlation of $X$ and $Y$ captures the influence of $Z$.  
  
- **Coincidence: cosmic happenstance?** 
  Is there a causal mechanism to link $\Delta X$ to $\Delta Y$?

# Role of research design

- Experiments
  - Randomize unit's exposure to treatment
  - Control to ensure comparability

- Observational studies
  - Careful case selection  
  - Condition on observables, (e.g., multiple regression)

# Examples: work through together

- For the below: identify causal claim and one alternative explanation they fail to rule out.
  - Kindle could cost you
  - Every mass shooting...

- Cohen and Dupas  
  - Central question
  - Motivation  
  - Research design (and role of design)
  - Findings
